# geneanalysis
An end-to-end Bioinformatics pipeline integrating Python CGI, Oracle SQL, and Machine Learning. This project parses raw honeybee gene sequences, calculates nucleotide frequencies, and stores data via batch processing. Features a 7-cluster K-Means analysis visualized in 3D to identify genomic patterns based on chemical composition.
